Generate [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas (v3) from Typescript types generated by the Supabase CLI.

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/supabase-to-zod.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/supabase-to-zod)

## Usage

```sh
$ pnpm add --D supabase-to-zod
$ supabase gen types typescript --local > types.ts
$ pnpm supabase-to-zod --input types.ts --output schemas.ts
```

That's it, go to `schemas.ts` file, you should have a schema for all tables, views, enums and functions.

## Authors Note
This project was created in a few hours during the Launchweek VI hackathon and the approach is **very** hacky: It transforms the nested `Database` type generated by the Supabase CLI into flat types, and passes them through `ts-to-zod` to generate zod schemas. A proper solution would be using the pg-meta API to generate zod schemas directly from the source of truth, similar to how the Typescript types are generated. Maybe that is something for version 2 of this libary.
